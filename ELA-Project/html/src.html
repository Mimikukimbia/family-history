        <p class="p">The reason that I have little information about my family is because the census was useless where my </p>
        <p class="p">family came from. The idea of a census was to go to a house and check how many people lived there. </p>
        <p class="p">They did not ask for the names of the people, what their ages were, the religion of the family and ect. This </p>
