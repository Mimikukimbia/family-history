            <p>In the past generations of my family we were mostly farmers. For my grandmother</p>
        <p>her life was mostly to farm, herd the sheep, and go to school, but school did not have</p>
        <p>a lot of emphasis. For my grandfather is was mainly the same. However my grandfather</p>
        <p> had the choice to have education all the way to high school. Instead he only went up to 7th grade.  </p>
        <p> We do not know why he did that but gladly all of my father's brothers and sisters decided to go to high school</p>
        <p> and finish it. I am here currently in the U.S because my father worked hard in school</p>
        <p> and that got him accepted to a University in New York. From there he got a Phd and</p>
        <p>decided to stay in the U.S.</p>
